# AT Reader
This tool collects data on SpyParty action tests from client view. Information like how the AT looked like and its result get saved to a log file, allowing for later thorough analysis.
It's also streamer-ready with its continuously updated text file containing key stats.
## How to set up
First install [mss](https://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss). Run **ATPractise.py** to start a practise session.
Initial run should create a *Data/prefs.txt* file â€“ here you can input the pixel coordinates of where your ATs will be located. Use this guide:
